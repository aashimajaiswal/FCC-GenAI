No power unit may be used in a given Championship season unless the Power Unit Manufacturer \\nsupplying such power unit accepts and adheres to the following conditions. \\nEach of the Power Unit Manufacturers of an homologated power unit must: \\n1. provide the FIA, before 15 May (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the \\nPower Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power \\nunits are to be supplied, with the list of teams (clearly identifying the appointed \\n“works/factory” team, if any) to which a supply agreement has been concluded for the \\ngiven Championship season; \\n2. if called upon to do so by the FIA before 1 June (or such other date as agreed in writing \\nbetween all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in \\nwhich such power units were to be supplied, supply at least a number of teams (“T”) equal \\nto the following equation: \\nT = (111-A)/(B-C) \\n- A = Total number of teams (including “works/factory” teams) having a supply agreement \\nconcluded for the given Championship season with a New Power Unit Manufacturer. \\n- B = Total number of manufacturers of homologated Power Units for the given \\nChampionship season. \\n- C = Total number of New Power Unit Manufacturers for the given Championship season. \\nprovided that if the result contains a fraction then the fraction shall count as a full team \\n(e.g. 11 teams divided by 4 manufacturers = 2.75, each manufacturer must, if called \\nupon to do so by the FIA, supply at least 3 teams). \\n 1  This figure will be reviewed each year as the “total number of entered teams” will not be known until \\nNovember preceding the Championship season. The figure of 11 covers supply of 12 teams or less in compliance with \\nthe calculation rule. \\nIn doing so, the FIA will first allocate the power unit supply between the Power Unit \\nManufacturers that are supplying the fewest number of teams, provided that the teams \\nwithout a supply agreement shall be allocated to the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) that \\nsupplies(supply) the lowest number of teams and so on. If there is more than one Power \\nUnit Manufacturer supplying the fewest number of teams (i.e. in the same position) \\nand/or more than one team requesting a supply the allocation between such Power Unit \\nManufacturers shall occur by ballot (which ballot shall be transparent and undertaken by \\nthe FIA in the presence of a representative of each of the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) and \\nthe new Customer Team concerned).'),\n",

The FIA shall be entitled to request a Power Unit Manufacturer to supply a team ( “New \\nCustomer Team”) with a power unit under the terms of this Appendix except if, at the date set \\nout in Article b) i) above: \\n- Such team has entered into a supply agreement with a Power Unit Manufacturer for a \\ngiven Championship season before the date set out in Article b) i) above, and \\n- Such team has been granted a right, under a currently binding offer with a Power Unit \\nManufacturer, to be supplied with a power unit for such given Championship season. \\nMoreover, such Power Unit Manufacturer shall only be required to supply a New Customer \\nTeam if the following cumulative conditions are met. If such conditions are not met, then the \\nPower Unit Manufacturer may, at its sole and exclusive discretion, decline the request to supply \\nsuch New Customer Team and the decline of such request shall not be deemed to be a breach \\nof the terms set out in this Appendix (however Article c) cannot be applied or interpreted by the \\nPower Unit Manufacturer in a way which would d eprive the obligation of supply as referred to \\nin Article b) above of any effect and/or that would prevent the FIA from making and enforcing \\nthe provisions set out in Article b) above. The Power Unit Manufacturer undertakes to exercise \\nin good faith the co nditions referred to in paragraph 1 to 11 below). The teams and the Power \\nUnit Manufacturers remain free to negotiate the terms of the supply agreement, subject to the \\nfall-back positions set out below which shall apply should a team and a Power Unit Manufacturer \\nfail to reach an agreement, despite negotiating in good faith. \\n1. For the purpose of this paragraph, supply contract only refers to the contract related to \\nthe FIA Supply Perimeter as per the Sporting and Technical Regulations and as set out in \\nthe relevant column of the first table in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations. \\n1.1.

Restricted Aerodynamic testing is the testing by a Competitor or any Associate of a \\nCompetitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate of a \\nCompetitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own \\npurposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor in a test \\nenvironment or numerical simulation of a representation of an F1 car or sub -component \\nin order to measure, observe or infer any forces, displacements, pressures or air flow \\ndirection resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow. \\nb. A three-dimensional representation of an F1 car or sub -component subject to Restricted \\nAerodynamic testing, defined either physically or digitally, will be considered for the \\npurposes of this Article as a Restricted Aerodynamic Test Geometry (RATG) and sav e for \\nwhere specifically permitted by this Article may not be added to, removed from, morphed \\nor modified. In order to prevent Restricted Aerodynamic testing methodologies intended \\nto subvert any limits on the number or nature of RATGs permitted under the ATR the \\nfollowing will apply: \\ni. The purpose of a RATG is to allow aerodynamic assessment of a single new \\ngeometry, with aerodynamic dependency maintained throughout the simulated \\nflow field. Any attempt to derive aerodynamically independent results for \\nsubcomponents of a RATG, either in the initial simulation or test, or by subsequent \\nmodification to the simulation or test conditions, is not permitted. Any attempt to \\nuse boundary conditions or similar to infer the effect of combining RATGs, without \\naccruing a further RATG, is also not per mitted. The use of boundary conditions \\ncannot be exploited to simulate the effect on the fluid of a geometry which is \\ndifferent from the RATG in use. \\nii. If the representation contains external bodywork surfaces on both sides of the \\ncentre plane of the car these must be symmetrical about this plane with the \\nexception of the wheel bodywork defined by Article 3.13 of the Technical \\nRegulations. Minimal exceptions for parts directly associated with the cooling of \\nthe power unit, or changes of car attitude allowed under sections 3d (roll and steer) \\nand 4 will be permitted. \\niii. Excluding permitted degrees of fre edom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, the \\nsubstitution or replacement of any part of a RATG with a non -F1 car geometry, or \\nthe placement of any physical or computational boundary condition or solver \\nsetting, that simulates or attempts to simulate a modificat ion to this RATG will be \\nconsidered as a new RATG.  \\niv. Sections (or sub -models) of a RATG which is used for RCFDs may be created by \\nremoving geometry from the parent RATG and placing boundary conditions of \\nvelocity or pressure profiles generated entirely from the same RATG to replicate'),\n",

This will not be \\nconsidered as a new RATG provided any geometry within the section is identical to \\nthe parent RATG. Exceptionally where downstream portions of the RATG are \\nremoved these may be replaced with a single geometry approved for this purpose \\nby the FIA. \\nv. Sections (or sub -models) of a RATG used for RCFDs and created by removing \\ngeometry from a parent RATG may not be subsequently geometrically modified \\nwithout being considered as a new RATG. Any boundary conditions of velocity or \\npressure profiles added in t he process of creating the section (or sub -model) and \\nused to replicate the flow field resulting from the geometry that has been removed \\nmay not be changed to boundary condition or profiles other than those generated \\nfrom the parent RATG without being considered a new RATG. \\nvi. If the representation contains surfaces that represent components of more than \\none F1 car then it shall be construed as the equivalent number of RATGs. Excluding \\npermitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, any subsequent \\nmodification of the  relative position of the representations of F1 cars will be \\nconsidered as new RATGs equivalent to the number of F1 car representations. \\nvii. A baseline RATG is defined as a reference chosen from time to time that serves for \\ncomparison purposes.  \\nc. An Aerodynamic Testing Period (ATP) is a period of consecutive calendar weeks for the \\npurposes of evaluation of the limits within this Article. As soon as one ATP ends a new one \\nbegins, with no gaps between them. \\nThere will be 6 ATPs in any year. The dates of these periods will be as follows: \\ni. Period 1 will start on 1 January and finish at the end of week 9. \\nii. Periods 2, 3 and 5 will run for exactly 8 weeks each. \\niii. Period 4 will run for 10 weeks, comprising the Summer Factory Shutdown described \\nin Article 24.1. \\niv. Period 6 will end on the 31 December. \\nFor the above definition, weeks are assumed to start on a Monday and week 1 is the first \\nweek of four days or more in the calendar year. \\nIn exceptional circumstances the FIA may revise these ATP at its absolute discretion in \\naccordance with changes or events likely to affect these restrictions. \\nd. In the context of this Article the words bodywork  and sprung suspension will have the \\nsame definition as those provided by Article 3 and Article 10 of the Technical Regulations. \\nAny data acquired during Restricted Aerodynamic testing may only be available to the \\nCompetitor that acquired it through use of the restricted aerodynamic testing available \\nto it in accordance with the limits in this Article.'),\n",

Each Competitor may nominate only one wind tunnel for use in any one twelve month \\nperiod and declare it in writing to the FIA. For a new entrant, the nomination must be made no \\nlater than 7 days after the date on which it officially becomes a Competitor. No re -nominations \\nmay be made for at least 12 months. Nominations should include the facility location, unique \\nidentification of the wind tunnel and the scale of model and RATG to be used. The FIA will \\nconsider, at its absolute discretion, earlier or temporary n ominations if a wind tunnel already \\nnominated by a Competitor suffers a long term failure or for the purpose of evaluating \\nalternative wind tunnels. If a different facility is to be used or if the existing facility is changed or \\nupgraded, other than for routine maintenance or replacement, then a new declaration must be \\nsubmitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing \\nperiod report whichever is earlier. \\n For the avoidance of doubt, any RWTT carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the \\nCompetitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of the \\nCompetitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own purposes \\nand subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor must take place in the wind \\ntunnel nominated by the Competitor. \\na. The limits for RWTT will be the number of runs of RWTT, the amount of wind tunnel \\noccupancy time and wind tunnel wind-on time. \\ni. During RWTT a single run will be deemed to commence each time the wind tunnel \\nair speed rises above 5m/s and will end the first time thereafter it falls below 5m/s.  \\nii. During RWTT, once the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s the RATG must \\nremain fixed and unmodified until the wind tunnel air speed returns below 1m/s.  \\niii. Between runs of RWTT detail changes to the RATG and model are permitted. \\nb. Wind on time is defined as the amount of time in hours summed over the ATP, where the \\nwind tunnel air speed exceeds 15m/s for RWTT.  \\nc. During RWTT, the first shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the \\nwind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s on a given calendar day, and will end at a time, \\ndeclared by the Competitor, when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s on the same \\ncalendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the \\nwind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on \\nthe same calenda r day) and will end, either when the wind tunnel air spee d falls below \\n5m/s for the last time on the same calendar day or, at the end of the calendar day in the \\nevent a run is still in progress.

Particle image velocimetry systems where the wind tunnel \\nair transports a flow visualisation medium are permitted. \\nb. No RWTT may be carried out using a scale model and RATG which is greater than 60% of \\nfull size neither may it be carried out at a wind tunnel air speed exceeding 50m/s \\nmeasured relative to the scale model and RATG. Furthermore, during restricted wind \\ntunnel testing the magnitude of the rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed measured \\nrelative to the scale model and RATG must be less than 4.5m/s². The rate of change of the \\nwind tunnel air speed will be defined as the derivative of wind tunnel air speed a nd \\nsmoothed using a moving average filter, centred on each sample, of period 0.5 seconds \\nduring each wind tunnel air speed ramp up and ramp down phase. These phases are \\ndefined as the periods when the wind tunnel air speed is varying between 15m/s and 95% \\nof the maximum wind tunnel air speed during a run. \\nc. Only one model and RATG may be used per run. A maximum of two models may be used \\nand a single model change made per Competitor per 24 hour period. For the avoidance \\nof doubt, a model in this context is defined by its underlying spine, motors and sensors. \\nIn order to prevent testing which aims to develop for the 2026 season, from 1/12/2023 \\nuntil 1/1/2025 inclusive, RWTT may only be carried out using a scale model that \\nsubstantially complies with the 2023, 2024 or 2025 F1 Technical Regulations.

A description correct at the start of the simulation or test of each RATG that is subject to \\nRWTT or that is counted against the maximum permitted new RATGs for RCFDs in any ATP \\nmust be recorded with a clear description such that it is possible to easily identify the \\nnature of the changes under evaluation. These descriptions will form part of the report \\nrequired by Section 6. d) above. \\ni. In order to verify the Restricted Aerodynamic testing facilities employed by the \\nCompetitors and as a means of assuring common application of the restrictions set out in \\nthis Article, the FIA will arrange for independent benchmarking inspections of both wi nd \\ntunnel and CFD activities to be carried out from time to time. Recommendations arising \\nfrom these inspections will be incorporated into this Article. \\nj. Failure to comply with the limits of the ATR by a Competitor will result in a reduction of \\nthe limits that will apply to subsequent ATP or ATPs for that Competitor at the FIA’s \\nabsolute discretion but by a minimum reduction equivalent to 10 multiples of the amount \\nby which the relevant limit or limits were exceeded without prejudice to further \\nappropriate action. (For example, if a Competitor carries out 325 restricted wind tunnel \\nruns against a maximum of 320 in an ATP, that Competitor shall only be permit ted to \\nmake 270 restricted wind tunnel runs during the next ATP). \\n7 Movement of personnel \\nNo Competitor may use movement of personnel involved in the development, design or testing \\nof aerodynamic surfaces (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other \\ntype of permanent or temporary personnel) with another Competitor, either directly or via an \\nexternal entity, for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of this Article. In order that \\nthe FIA may be satisfied that any such movement of staff is compliant with this Article, each \\nCompetitor must inform the  FIA of all relevant staff movements at the end of each ATP using \\nthe template which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations and \\nmust demonstrate that they have implemented all reasonable measures to avoid the disclosure \\nof information, data or designs between the Competitors involved.'),\n",
